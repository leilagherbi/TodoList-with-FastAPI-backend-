I PUT THIS WORK ON YPUR HANDS, I MADE A BACKEND TODO LIST WITH FAST API.
Project Setup:

Create a project directory and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended).
Install FastAPI using pip install fastapi.
Data Model:

Define a Pydantic data model for each task. This model describes what information you want to store, like title, description (optional), and completion status (boolean).
FastAPI Endpoints:

Use FastAPI decorators like @app.get and @app.post to create endpoints for your app.
These endpoints define routes (e.g., /tasks) that users can interact with.
Creating Tasks:

Implement an endpoint to create new tasks.
Use body parsers like Body(...) to receive task information in JSON format.
FastAPI automatically validates the data against your Pydantic model.
Optionally, store the task in a database using a library like SQLAlchemy.
Retrieving Tasks:

Create an endpoint to list all tasks.
Optionally, retrieve tasks from your database and return them as a response.
Additional Functionality:

Build more endpoints for actions like:
Getting a specific task by ID.
Updating existing tasks.
Marking tasks complete/incomplete.
Deleting tasks.
Dependency Injection (Optional):

For database interactions, leverage FastAPI's dependency injection.
Define a function to manage the database connection.
Inject this function into your endpoints using Depends(...).
Testing and Running:

Use tools like curl or Postman to send test requests and verify your API.
Run your app using a server like Uvicorn (uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000).
